# Url shortener with custom links

### Create url shortener with your custom domain and custom links!

#### How to set up?

Firstly, you need to go to [deta](https://www.deta.sh/) (free hosting platform perfect for developers with small projects),
create account, then create new key in settings and put it in the `.env` file as here `DETA = "keywithsemicolons"`.
Then do this:

  1. Download the project
  2. Open terminal in the project folder
  3. Run `npm install` then `npm run start`
  5. The app should run on port [8080](http://localhost:8080)

On default directory there you can create shortened link and access it from `yourdomain.tld/link/yourlink`
